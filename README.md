We have already spent almost two month on this course. so my updates are as follow:
#1.The students who will not submit their assignments before Tuesday 29, otherwise you are going to take a test on next friday. #2. next friday, you are going to present to me what are going to do as a final project, otherwise, I will suggest a project for you, based on the the presentation you have already made.
